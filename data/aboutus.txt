Emerging from a collaboration on a simple school 
project, Delta H was established in January, 2022 
by Divij Mahajan and Harshit Rai Verma, marking 
the start of their new journey into the ever 
growing tech field. We at Delta H solve problems, 
generate ideas, discover the extent of tech and 
provide amazing software for a variety of 
purposes. Our mission is to provide people with
efficient, reliable and useful applications and
softwares to help in their day to day life.
